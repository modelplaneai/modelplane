# Modelplane Scheduling — Design

> Federation matcher + renderer composition functions. **API shape is owned by [#64](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/pull/64)** — this doc points at the implementation that consumes it.
>
> **Status:** sketch. The code under `functions/` doesn't run yet — it targets API protos that haven't been generated. The shape, dependencies, and use cases are real; the wiring is gated on #64 landing.

## Architecture

Two Crossplane composition functions, one IR between them.

## What lives where

The composition functions are split into **pure modules** (algorithm, dict-builders, dispatch tables — no Crossplane imports) and an **orchestrator** `main.py` that glues phases together with required-resources + status writes. The boundary keeps the algorithm testable in isolation and makes "what's Crossplane logic vs scheduling logic" obvious in a glance.

### Composer — `compose-model-deployment/`

| File | Pure? | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`scheduling.py`](../../functions/compose-model-deployment/scheduling.py) | ✓ | Federation matcher algorithm. `match(md, clusters, existing) → MatchResult`. Plain dataclasses, no I/O. |
| [`adapters.py`](../../functions/compose-model-deployment/adapters.py) | boundary | Proto / observed-XR ⇄ scheduling dataclasses. Three load functions: `load_md`, `load_clusters`, `load_existing`. |
| [`emitters.py`](../../functions/compose-model-deployment/emitters.py) | ✓ | Pure dict builders for composed `ModelReplica` / `ModelEndpoint` resources. |
| [`main.py`](../../functions/compose-model-deployment/main.py) | orchestrator | Crossplane glue — six phases (REQUIRE → LOAD → MATCH → BUILD → EMIT → STATUS), each clearly banner-commented. State machine for `Scheduled` / `ReplicasReady` conditions. |

### Renderer — `compose-model-placement/`

| File | Pure? | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`rendering.py`](../../functions/compose-model-placement/rendering.py) | ✓ | Build KServe LLM-IS spec + DRA `ResourceClaim` spec + selector CEL from class capabilities. |
| [`scheduler.py`](../../functions/compose-model-placement/scheduler.py) | ✓ | Per-scheduler wrap dispatch (KAI: `schedulerName` + `PodGroup`; Kueue: queue label + `suspend`; none: pass-through). |
| [`adapters.py`](../../functions/compose-model-placement/adapters.py) | boundary | Proto / observed-MR ⇄ rendering dataclasses. |
| [`main.py`](../../functions/compose-model-placement/main.py) | orchestrator | Seven phases (REQUIRE-cluster → REQUIRE-classes → LOAD → RENDER → WRAP → EMIT → STATUS). State machine for `Ready` (with cold-start sub-states `Pulling` / `LWSGangPending` / `EngineLoading`). |

### Capacity adapter — `lib/capacity_adapter/`

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`common.py`](../../lib/capacity_adapter/common.py) | Shared types: `ResourceCount`, `PoolCapacity`, `CapacitySnapshot`. `write_status()` builds the `IC.status.capacity` patch. |
| [`kai.py`](../../lib/capacity_adapter/kai.py) | KAI Queue / ResourcePool → CapacitySnapshot. |
| [`kueue.py`](../../lib/capacity_adapter/kueue.py) | Kueue ClusterQueue.flavorsUsage → CapacitySnapshot. |

Runs as a **separate controller**, not a composition function — continuous poll/watch loop against each cluster's scheduler status CRDs.

## Tests

```bash
# One-time setup (until repo's nix toolchain is wired):
uv venv .venv-test
uv pip install --python .venv-test/bin/python pytest ruff pyright

# Run unit tests
.venv-test/bin/python -m pytest tests/unit -v
# Lint
.venv-test/bin/ruff check functions/ lib/
```

| Layer | Files | Coverage today |
|---|---|---|
| **Static** | `pyproject.toml` configures `ruff` (linting) + `pyright` (typing) over `functions/` and `lib/`. | All clean. |
| **Pure unit tests** | [`tests/unit/`](../../tests/unit/) — 69 tests covering `scheduling.py` (topology, filtering, capacity, sticky placement, disagg, trace), `scheduler.py` (KAI / Kueue / none dispatch + gang sizing), `rendering.py` (LLM-IS shape + DRA selector CEL), and `lib/capacity_adapter/` (projection from KAI / Kueue status). | 69/69 green; runs in ~20ms. |
| **Composition tests** | Existing `tests/test-*/` pattern (Upbound `up` CLI). New shapes wired once #64's protos land — `tests/test-model-deployment-v2/`, `tests/test-model-replica-{kai,kueue}/`. | Deferred. |
| **E2E** | Real cluster running KAI or Kueue. | Out of scope for this PR. |

## Dependencies — what each function reads / writes

**`compose-model-deployment`**

| Direction | Resource | Why |
|---|---|---|
| reads | `InferenceCluster` (all, cluster-scoped) | candidate fleet |
| reads | `InferenceClass` (referenced by pools) | capabilities for CEL eval |
| reads | `ModelReplica` (owned by this MD) | sticky placement + capacity used |
| writes | `ModelReplica` × `spec.replicas` | the IR |
| writes | `ModelEndpoint` × `spec.replicas` | reachable URL surface (per #64) |
| writes | MD status conditions | `Scheduled` / `ReplicasReady` / matchTrace |

**`compose-model-placement`**

| Direction | Resource | Why |
|---|---|---|
| reads | `InferenceCluster` (just the matched one) | kubeconfig + pool→class mapping |
| reads | `InferenceClass` × {decode, prefill} | derive DRA selector from capabilities |
| writes | `LLMInferenceService` (on target cluster) | the actual workload |
| writes | `ResourceClaim` × roles (on target cluster) | DRA device binding |
| writes | MR status conditions | `Ready` / `Pulling` / `LWSGangPending` / `EngineLoading` |

KEDA `ScaledObject`s are user-authored per Nic's design (mirroring Deployment + HPA) — not composed by Modelplane. Modelplane only exposes `MD.spec.replicas` via the scale subresource.

## KAI / Kueue integration

Stage-2 (in-cluster) scheduling. Two interception models, dispatched per-cluster.

**API extension to [#64](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/pull/64).** Nic's sketch doesn't model a scheduler axis. We propose adding `InferenceCluster.spec.scheduler.{type}` with values `auto` (default) · `managed-kai` · `managed-kueue` · `kai` · `kueue` · `none`. The renderer dispatches on this. `auto` resolves at IC onboarding by detecting CRDs (`Project` ⇒ KAI, `ClusterQueue` ⇒ Kueue, neither ⇒ install `managed-kueue`).

### What changes per scheduler

| | KAI | Kueue | none |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pod-level** | `schedulerName: kai-scheduler` on every pod the LLM-IS produces | unchanged | unchanged |
| **Workload-level** | unchanged | `kueue.x-k8s.io/queue-name` label + `suspend: true` (Kueue ungates on admission) | unchanged |
| **Companion object** | `PodGroup` CRD wrapping the LWS gang (`minMember = total pods`); pods labeled with the matching `pod-group.scheduling.run.ai/name` | none — Kueue's webhook creates `Workload` from the queue label | none |
| **Capacity source** | `Queue.status` + `ResourcePool.status` per Project | `ClusterQueue.status.flavorsUsage[]` | direct node listing |

The matcher reads `IC.status.capacity` and is **agnostic** to which adapter populated it — same shape across schedulers.

### Where it's wired

```
ModelReplica
    │
    ▼
compose-model-placement/main.py
    │  build base LLM-IS spec (decode + optional prefill)
    │
    ├──▶ scheduler.wrap(IC.spec.scheduler.type, llmis_spec, ...)
    │       │
    │       ├─ wrap_kai     → set schedulerName, stamp pod label, emit PodGroup
    │       ├─ wrap_kueue   → stamp queue label, suspend: true
    │       └─ wrap_none    → pass-through
    │
    ▼
remote-cluster apply: LLM-IS + DRA ResourceClaims + scheduler companion objects
```

Adding a new scheduler (Volcano, etc.):
1. New `wrap_<name>` in `scheduler.py` (one function).
2. Add to `_DISPATCH` map.
3. New module under `lib/capacity_adapter/<name>.py` returning the same `CapacitySnapshot` shape.
4. Add to `IC.spec.scheduler.type` enum.

No matcher changes. No MD changes. The IR (`ModelReplica`) doesn't know which scheduler is involved.

### Capacity feedback loop

```

                                                          │

                                            (controller-runtime watcher,
                                             one per IC, polls every ~5s)

                                                          ▼

                                                          │
                                                          ▼
                                            federation matcher reads this
                                            on the next placement
```

A few seconds of staleness is fine — we don't reserve, we admit. If the matcher picks a saturated cluster, the in-cluster scheduler holds the workload Pending; next reconcile re-evaluates.

## Use cases — how each one flows through the code

### A. Single-node, single-GPU (gpt-oss-20b)

[`examples/workloads/gpt-oss-20b.yaml`](./examples/workloads/gpt-oss-20b.yaml) — `topology.strategy: Tensor, tensor: 1`.

```
MD.replicas: 2
  → compose-model-deployment
      scheduling.match():
        per replica index 0..1:
          filter ICs by clusterSelector.matchLabels (tier=production)
          for each pool: eval nodeSelector.cel (vramGiB >= 24)
            → pool fits if class.gpu_count >= 1 (Tensor 1)
            → free nodes >= 1 (1 node, 1 GPU)
          score by headroom + spread bonus
      emits 2 ModelReplica + 2 ModelEndpoint
  → compose-model-placement (per MR)
      Tensor strategy → workerSpec.replicas=1, single pod, 1 GPU
      ResourceClaim: 1 GPU against the matched class's CEL
```

### B. Multi-node TP+PP (Kimi K2)

[`examples/workloads/kimi-k2.yaml`](./examples/workloads/kimi-k2.yaml) — `strategy: TensorPipeline, tensor: 8, pipeline: 2`.

```
MD.replicas: 1 (no ScaledObject — fixed)
  → compose-model-deployment
      scheduling.match():
        Topology.shape() returns (2 nodes_per_inst, 8 gpus_per_node)
        node_selector_cel: vramGiB>=141 && fp8 in features && IB 400Gbps
        capacity check: pool.max_nodes - used >= 2
      emits 1 ModelReplica
  → compose-model-placement
      TensorPipeline → LWS group of size 2
      ResourceClaim: 8 GPUs per pod × 2 pods = 16 total
```

### C. Disaggregated P/D (Llama-405B style)

`prefill:` block at MD spec level; top-level fields are decode. Existing examples don't carry this shape yet (will be updated to match Nic's #64). The trace below shows what the matcher would do.

```
MD.replicas: 1, decode (TensorPipeline 8x2 instances=3),
              prefill (Tensor 1 instances=5)
  → compose-model-deployment
      scheduling.match():
        for each candidate IC:
          find decode pools (>=141 GiB + IB)
          find prefill pools (>=80 GiB + IB)  ← potentially same IC, different pool
          pair (decode_pool, prefill_pool) — same cluster (KV co-location)
          capacity check: decode needs 6 nodes (3*2), prefill 5 (5*1)
      emits 1 ModelReplica with both target.decodePool and target.prefillPool
  → compose-model-placement
      LLM-IS spec has spec.workerSpec (decode) + spec.prefill.workerSpec
      2 ResourceClaims (one per role)
      KV transfer config flows through engine.args opaquely
```

### D. Scale-up across the fleet

```
KEDA ScaledObject writes MD.spec.replicas: 1 → 4
  → compose-model-deployment re-runs:
      scheduling.match():
        replica 0: existing → sticky (no re-placement)
        replicas 1..3: new
          working set tracks decisions made *this pass* so replica 2
          doesn't double-count what replica 1 just consumed
      result: 4 ModelReplicas, possibly across multiple ICs
              (matcher picks based on capacity headroom)
  → compose-model-placement renders 3 new LLM-ISs across the chosen ICs
```

Cross-cluster spread is implicit — falls out of the capacity-headroom score, not a separate code path.

### E. Cluster degrades

```
External eviction controller (out of scope for this PR) writes annotation
  modelplane.ai/evict=true on affected ModelReplicas.
  → compose-model-deployment notices the annotation,
    drops those replicas from `existing`, treats their indices as new,
    matcher picks again excluding the degraded IC
  → compose-model-placement renders on the new target
  → old LLM-IS GC'd by Crossplane when the MR is deleted
```

## What's *not* in this PR

Listed so the surface is honest:

- The new XRDs themselves — that's Nic's territory in [#64](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/pull/64). Once they merge, we regenerate the protos under `functions/*/model/` and the `_load_md` / `_resolve_clusters` stubs in this code become real.
- KEDA `ScaledObject` composer — Nic's design has the user (or a higher-level Composition) author one, not Modelplane.
- ~~KAI scheduler integration~~ — sketched in this PR (`scheduler.py` dispatch + `lib/capacity_adapter/kai.py`). Requires a small extension to Nic's #64 (`IC.spec.scheduler.type`).
- ~~Kueue scheduler integration~~ — sketched in this PR (`scheduler.py` dispatch + `lib/capacity_adapter/kueue.py`).
- Per-version KServe adapter dispatch (v0.16 / v0.17 / v0.18) — sketched as a TODO comment in `_worker_spec`. Today we render v0.18 only.
- The eviction controller and the capacity-status puller — separate processes, not composition functions. Out of scope here.
- A real CEL evaluator — `scheduling.eval_cel` is a placeholder. Production wires `cel-python` or a Go shim.
- Tests — the matcher's pure-Python isolation makes it easy to add table-driven tests; deferred so this PR stays focused on *shape*.

## Delta from existing scheduling on `main`

The repo today has a single-cluster placement function in [`functions/compose-model-deployment/scheduling.py` on `main`](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/blob/main/functions/compose-model-deployment/scheduling.py) (~130 lines). This branch reworks it into a fleet-level federation scheduler. The conceptual deltas:

| | Existing on `main` | This branch |
|---|---|---|
| **Mental model** | Per-deployment, picks N matching `InferenceEnvironment`s up to `spec.environments` | Per-replica, picks `(InferenceCluster, pool)` for each of `spec.replicas` |
| **Unit of placement** | `ModelPlacement` per matched env (1:1 with env, model-VRAM-derived GPU count) | `ModelReplica` per logical replica (1:1 with `spec.replicas`, topology-driven shape) |
| **Capacity input** | `env.status.capacity.gpuPools[]` — runtime-observed VRAM/node counts | `IC.status.capacity` — **normalized** by per-scheduler adapter (Kueue / KAI / Volcano), pool-level free counts |
| **Pool eligibility** | Fixed math: `model_vram / pool_memory` ≥ enough VRAM | CEL predicate over typed `InferenceClass.capabilities` (vendor, product, vramGiB, features, interconnect, …) |
| **Topology** | Implicit (multi-node iff `gpus_needed > countPerNode`); single TP-like math | Explicit discriminated-union: `Tensor` / `TensorPipeline` / `DataExpert`, with `instances` per role |
| **Disaggregation** | Not supported | First-class. Decode + prefill are separate roles, scheduled together but to (potentially) different pools, **same cluster** required (KV cache transfer) |
| **Engine matching** | `serving.match_profile(model, env)` walks a priority-ordered `serving[]` array on `ClusterModel` | No serving profiles. Engine is single-config on the MD; engine features are pass-through (Nic's #64) |
| **Scaling** | Hard-coded set `{Fixed, Concurrency}`; checked inline | Out of scope — KEDA `ScaledObject` is user-authored; we expose the scale subresource only |
| **Stickiness** | Sort: existing-first by name | Per-replica `replicaIndex` carried from existing MR; scheduler reuses without recomputing |
| **Multi-replica accounting** | One `schedule()` call returns N candidates; capacity isn't reserved across the call | Filter / Score / **Bind** pass reserves consumed capacity in a working set so subsequent replicas don't double-count |
| **Algorithm structure** | Single loop with inline filtering + sort | Explicit Filter → Score → Bind phases (matches K8s SIG-Scheduling vocabulary) |
| **Result shape** | `list[Candidate(name, gateway_address, profile_name)]` | `ScheduleResult(placements: list[Placement], trace: list[MatchTrace])` — separates decisions from per-cluster rejection trace |
| **`matchTrace`** | Not surfaced; failures collapse to "no candidates" | Per-(cluster, pool, reason, detail) trace surfaced on `MD.status.matchTrace` so users see *why* every candidate was rejected |
| **Cluster source** | Single source — `InferenceEnvironment` (one cluster type) | Multi-source: managed clouds + `Existing` BYOC (kubeconfig) — orchestrator-detected scheduler / backend / DRA |
| **In-cluster integration** | None — assumed kube-scheduler default everywhere | Stage-2 dispatch in renderer (`scheduler.py`): KAI emits PodGroup, Kueue stamps queue label + suspend |
| **Lines of code** | ~130 (single algorithm) | ~490 (algorithm) + ~280 (composer) + ~180 (emitters) + ~100 (adapters), modularized |

The shape change cascades: `apis/inferenceenvironments/` → `apis/inferenceclusters/`, `apis/clustermodels/` + `apis/models/` collapse into `ModelDeployment`, `ModelPlacement` → `ModelReplica`, plus a new `InferenceClass` for hardware bundles. API land lives in [#64](https://github.com/modelplaneai/modelplane/pull/64); this branch implements *against* that shape.

## What this PR is for

A working sketch reviewers can read end-to-end:

- **the matcher logic** (in `scheduling.py`) — what the federation layer actually does
- **the dependency graph** (this doc + the headers on each `main.py`) — what each function reads and writes
- **how the use cases land** (above) — concrete tracing from MD YAML to running pods
- **why BYO-anything is cheap** — the IR (`ModelReplica`) is the only seam each backend / scheduler / version needs to honor

If those four read clean, the design is in good shape. The wiring follows.
