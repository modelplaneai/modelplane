# Modelplane API Design — 1-pager

**Status:** Draft for Bassam review
**Author:** Dennis Ramdass
**Date:** 2026-05-07
**Scope:** API + scheduler + capability model. Heaviest on the scheduler/matching surface; touches the broader CRD shape and the adapter / plugin pattern that ties them together.

## TL;DR

- **Modelplane is a Crossplane-native, multi-cloud inference control plane.**
- **Cluster scope** holds substrate (`InferenceCluster`s — customer K8s — plus a singleton `CapabilityVocabulary`). **Namespace scope** is the lifecycle boundary (= environment): `ModelDeployment`, `ModelPlacement`, `ModelService`, `ModelEndpoint`.
- **Replica == placement.** One `ModelPlacement` per logical replica of a `ModelDeployment`. KEDA writes `MD.spec.replicas` via the K8s scale subresource; the composer reconciles MPs to match — no custom scaler.
- **Two-stage scheduling.** Modelplane is a *federation planner* — it evaluates predicates against *declared* pool capacity to pick `(cluster, pool)` per replica, before nodes exist. Per-cluster scheduling (and runtime grounding via DRA, where the cluster has it) is delegated. We borrow DRA's *vocabulary* (typed attributes, domain-prefixed keys, CEL) but not its Kinds — `ResourceClaim` / `ResourceSlice` / `DeviceClass` belong to the runtime allocator, not the federation layer.
- **Labels-first matching.** `deviceSelector.matchLabels` works on any K8s cluster with labeled nodes (no DRA needed). Typed `matchAttributes` + CEL is the break-glass for richer constraints (NVLink-domain co-location, MIG, FP8 capability) — evaluated against declared pool attributes, not runtime `ResourceSlice`s.
- **Adapter / plugin substrate.** `managed-kserve` (backend) + `managed-kueue` (scheduler) ship by default. BYO contracts (`InferenceCluster.spec.{backend, scheduler}.type`) plug in KAI / Volcano / Dynamo / raw-vllm. `ModelPlacement` (the IR) is the seam.
- **`ModelService` is a rough sketch.** Routing-only placeholder, never a placement target. **Nic owns the real design** for dedicated-SaaS placement (provisioning a Together / Baseten dedicated endpoint); the `ModelService` shape here is a stand-in pending that work.
- **CapabilityVocabulary as a managed canonical catalog.** Default ships chip generations, engine versions, quantization formats, KV tiers, fabric ordering, plus per-SKU instance-type macros. Customers override for bespoke hardware. Keeping it current is high-leverage and bounded — Upbound-managed-offering candidate.
- **Wedge:** fleet-level capabilities single-cluster platforms can't reach — fleet matching, geo + compliance routing, KV cache federation, sticky sessions, failover, cost-aware routing.

## Problem

VRAM-divided-by-per-GPU-memory worked for Llama-8B on an L4. It can't deploy Kimi K2, DeepSeek V4, or Llama 4 Behemoth on heterogeneous fleets. There's no way to say *"16 H200s in 2×8 layout, NVLink-grouped, IB-400G-or-better, FP8-quantized, EAGLE speculative decoding, 5P3D disaggregation"* and no way for a cluster to say *"I have that."* Baseten has these capabilities; gated behind support tickets, on Baseten's GPUs. Modelplane delivers them declaratively on customer infrastructure.

## Design principles

1. **Clean separation, no enforcement.** Platform teams own substrate; ML/App teams own workloads. Same API split or unified.
2. **Fleet-wide by construction.** A `ModelDeployment` targets the fleet of `InferenceCluster`s, not a single cluster. `matchTrace` reports where it fits and why elsewhere doesn't. SaaS endpoints participate via `ModelEndpoint` routing, not placement.
3. **Plain Crossplane customization.** Catalogs, defaults, governance live in Compositions, RBAC, OPA — not Modelplane primitives.
4. **No new in-cluster scheduler.** We're a meta-scheduler. K8s scheduler + DRA, Kueue, KEDA/HPA, Cluster Autoscaler each own their layer.

## Architecture: control plane + fleet

A diagram of the API and an example fleet topology lives in [`proposed-modelplane-api/diagram.excalidraw`](proposed-modelplane-api/diagram.excalidraw) — Bassam's whiteboard.


```
            Modelplane Control Plane (Crossplane)
   matcher: (cluster, pool) per replica → ModelPlacement (IR)
   backend adapter: ModelPlacement → upstream objects per cluster
                          ↓
   ─────────────── cluster scope ────────────────
   InferenceClusters (workload planes)
     scheduler (managed-kueue default) + backend (managed-kserve default)
     + DRA + KEDA on each cluster
   CapabilityVocabulary (singleton, name: default)

   ─────────────── namespace scope (= environment) ──
   per namespace: prod / staging / dev / team-A …
     ModelDeployment(s)    (workload spec; scale subresource)
     ModelPlacement(s)     (one per replica, IR)
     ModelService(s)       (routing-only target)
     ModelEndpoint         (weighted routing across MDs + MSes)
```

**Cluster scope** holds shared substrate (`InferenceCluster`s + the singleton `CapabilityVocabulary`). **Namespace scope** is the lifecycle boundary — each namespace is an environment (prod / staging / dev / per-team) holding workload, routing, and SaaS-target resources. The matcher considers only `InferenceCluster` candidates; `ModelService` is routing-only.

**Key architectural decisions:**

- Meta-scheduler only — compose objects, never bind devices or actuate replicas. `ClusterModel` / `Model` deleted; workload spec self-contained on `ModelDeployment`.
- **Replica == placement.** One `ModelPlacement` per logical replica. Each replica independently scheduled by the matcher against the MD's `clusterSelector`. KEDA writes `MD.spec.replicas` via the scale subresource; the composer reconciles MPs to match. No custom scaler.
- **Federation matches against declared pool attributes, not runtime DRA.** `InferenceCluster.spec.nodePools[].{node,device}Attributes` are the source of truth at the federation layer. DRA `ResourceSlice`s ground predicates at the per-cluster scheduling stage (next section).
- **Two-level selector cascade**: `clusterSelector` (env-level) → `deviceSelector` (node + device). Labels are the primary path; typed `matchAttributes` + CEL is the break-glass.
- **In-cluster scheduling delegated.** Bin-packing, gang scheduling, fractional GPU, NVLink-aware placement, capacity tracking — Kueue (default) / KAI / Volcano. Modelplane reads capacity signal back via `ClusterQueue.status.flavorsUsage[]`.
- `ModelPlacement` (existing CRD, `apis/modelplacements/`) is the **intermediate representation (IR)** — the seam between the matcher and the version-pinned backend adapter. Not a new abstraction; the role this existing CRD plays.
- Namespace = environment / lifecycle scope. Pushing a revision triggers lifecycle reconciliation in that namespace.

## Adapter / plugin substrate

Two layers are pluggable: the in-cluster scheduler and the inference backend. Default plugins ship; BYO via a contract on `InferenceCluster.spec`. `ModelPlacement` (the IR) is the seam.

| Layer | Default | BYO | Seam |
|---|---|---|---|
| In-cluster scheduler | **`managed-kueue`** (installs Kueue + `ClusterQueue` per pool) | `scheduler.type: kueue \| kai \| volcano \| none` | Admission CR (Kueue `Workload`, KAI/Volcano `PodGroup`) + capacity status (`ClusterQueue.status.flavorsUsage[]` or equivalent). |
| Inference backend | **`managed-kserve`** (installs KServe at pinned version + composes `KServeBackend`) | `backend.{type, version}: kserve \| dynamo \| raw-vllm` | Per-cluster adapter watches `ModelPlacement` and renders `LLMInferenceService` (KServe), `DynamoGraphDeployment` (Dynamo), or `Deployment+Service` (raw-vllm). Writes back to `ModelPlacement.status.rendered`. |

**Opinionated:** the IR schema, the matching logic, and the user-facing API. **Pluggable:** thin adapters per scheduler + per backend version. v1 ships Kueue + KServe (v0.16 / v0.17 / v0.18); KAI / Volcano / Dynamo are follow-ups. Customers keep existing investments (KAI for training, Volcano for batch, Dynamo for orchestration); Modelplane adds the fleet layer above.

## Two-stage scheduling: federation vs in-cluster

Modelplane and DRA solve different problems. DRA is a *runtime allocator* — drivers publish `ResourceSlice`s about real hardware, the K8s scheduler matches `ResourceClaim`s against them. Modelplane's federation layer schedules against *declared* pool capacity, before nodes exist. Planning, not allocation.

We borrow DRA's vocabulary, not its Kinds:

| Borrow (vocabulary) | Drop (Kinds) |
|---|---|
| Typed attributes, domain-prefixed keys, CEL predicates, `device.attributes[domain].name` access pattern | `DeviceClass` / `ResourceSlice` / `ResourceClaim` at the federation layer |

**Two stages, in order:**

1. **Federation match** (Modelplane control plane, pre-provisioning). `clusterSelector` filters `InferenceCluster` candidates; `deviceSelector` filters node pools within them. Output: `ModelPlacement` per replica, pinned to a `(cluster, pool)`. Fleet-aware, capacity-aware, cost-aware. Runs whether or not the cluster has DRA.
2. **In-cluster scheduling** (per-cluster, at pod admission). The backend adapter renders pods. *Optionally*, the adapter emits real `ResourceClaim`s carrying the same CEL predicates from `deviceSelector`; the DRA driver grounds them against actual hardware. Mismatch → pod Pending with a clear error.

**Grounding contract** (when the adapter emits `ResourceClaim`s):

- **BYOC + DRA**: emit. Pool attrs declared by the customer; independent grounding catches typos and drift.
- **Modelplane-provisioned**: optional. Attrs are derived from the SKU we asked for — drift is unlikely.
- **BYOC without DRA**: skip. Pod constraints fall back to `nodeSelector` + `topologySpreadConstraints`. Federation match still uses the same predicates.

User-facing API is unchanged across these. The decision is per-cluster, governed by `InferenceCluster.spec.provisioning.mode`.

## Fleet-level capabilities

Single-cluster platforms (llm-d, KServe alone, Dynamo) optimize within a cluster. Modelplane reaches across `InferenceCluster`s, with SaaS via `ModelService` routes.

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| Fleet matching | One `ModelDeployment` finds eligible clusters across regions, clouds, vendors; `matchTrace` shows why each fits or doesn't |
| Hardware-heterogeneous routing | One `ModelEndpoint` weighting across MDs on different hardware, plus `ModelService` routes for SaaS spillover |
| Geo + compliance routing | EU traffic to EU clusters; SOC 2 traffic only to certified clusters — via `clusterSelector` predicates |
| Cross-cluster replica scaling | Replicas of one MD spread across matching clusters; matcher picks per replica from capacity signal |
| Fleet KV cache federation | G4 networked cache as a global fabric; route to whichever cluster has the prefix |
| Fleet session affinity | Sticky sessions across regional ingresses; multi-turn chat lands on the same `(cluster, replica)` |
| Fleet failover | Active-active / active-passive cutover when a cluster degrades |
| Cost-aware routing | Cheapest fleet member that fits; blend reserved / on-demand / spot / per-token |
| Fleet overflow | Burst to a sibling cluster or `ModelService` when local capacity exhausts (#48) |
| Aggregated fleet observability | TTFT / ITL / cost / queue-depth rolled up across the fleet for one logical service |

What ships in v1 vs v2 is in the project plan section.

## Who owns what

| Owner | What they author |
|---|---|
| ML/App team | `ModelDeployment` (or a Composition over it), `ModelEndpoint` |
| Platform team — cluster scope | `InferenceCluster` per managed K8s cluster; default `CapabilityVocabulary` (or extensions); workload-plane substrate (KServe, DRA driver, Kueue, KEDA) — BYO or `managed-kserve` |
| Platform team — namespace scope | `ModelService` per SaaS endpoint; Compositions over `ModelDeployment` for org governance |
| Modelplane (the project) | The five user-facing CRDs + `ModelPlacement` (IR); composition functions (matcher + per-version backend adapter); drift detection controller; default `CapabilityVocabulary`; reference clusters; `managed-kserve` install manifests |

## How users consume it

**ML/App day-one.** Write a `ModelDeployment` (or instantiate a platform Composition like `ApprovedModel` that generates one). Matcher picks an `InferenceCluster` and emits one `ModelPlacement` per replica; the version-pinned adapter renders each MP to one upstream pod set. KEDA writes `MD.spec.replicas`; composer reconciles MPs. Endpoint reachable via `ModelEndpoint`. `matchTrace` shows what was considered and why excluded.

**Platform day-one.** Install Modelplane on the Crossplane control plane → install (or BYO) workload-plane substrate per cluster → create one `InferenceCluster` per cluster (or copy from `examples/reference-clusters/`) → create `ModelService`s for any SaaS endpoints → optionally extend `CapabilityVocabulary` and author Compositions.

## Extensibility points

| Extension | Owner | Why use it |
|---|---|---|
| Crossplane Compositions over `ModelDeployment` / substrate CRDs | Platform team | Org abstractions (`ApprovedModel`, `ProductionCluster`), approved-model catalogs, defaults, governance |
| `CapabilityVocabulary` extension | Platform team | Org-specific keys (compliance levels, custom hardware), engine feature names for forks, KV tier overrides — no CRD bump |
| `engine.args` opaque pass-through | ML/App team | Engine flags Modelplane doesn't model |
| `engine.advanced[]` named feature break-glass | ML/App team + platform team (declares on `KServeBackend`) | Novel features not yet in `engine.optimizations` — promote to typed over time |
| `<level>Selector.matchAttributes` / `cel` | Both teams | Org-specific match dimensions (cost center, team, clearance) and constraints not expressible in `matchLabels` |
| Custom composition functions | Platform / community / vendors | Replace matcher / composer / adapter with custom placement policy, cost model, or backend |
| Custom Crossplane providers | Platform / community / vendors | Programmatic creation of `InferenceCluster` (new cloud) or `ModelService` (new SaaS) |
| Forking | Community / vendors | Needs that don't fit the upstream roadmap |

## API shape

`ModelDeployment.spec` field skeleton (namespace-scoped; carries the K8s scale subresource so KEDA targets it directly):

```yaml
replicas: <int>                   # KEDA writes here; composer reconciles MPs to match
model: { name }                   # engine-facing identity
source: HuggingFace | S3 | GCS | PVC
huggingFace: { repo, revision, secretRef }

# Two-level selector cascade, filters InferenceCluster only:
clusterSelector:                  # env-level attrs (region, tier, compliance)
  matchLabels: {...}
  matchAttributes: [...]
  cel: ...
deviceSelector:                   # node + device attrs over declared pool capacity
  requests:
    - name, count, perNode
      matchLabels: {...}          # primary path (no DRA needed)
      matchAttributes: [...]      # break-glass; typed attribute predicates
      cel: ...
      constraints: [{ matchAttribute, requests }]   # NVLink-domain co-location, etc
# Deployment shape (Modelplane-canonical, backend adapter translates):
parallelism: { tensor, pipeline, expert }
roles:                            # disaggregated serving (xPyD)
  prefill: { deviceSelector, parallelism, replicas }   # any unset inherits root
  decode:  { deviceSelector, parallelism, replicas }

engine:
  name, image, args
  quantization: { precision, target }
  speculation:
    type: EAGLE | DraftTarget | Medusa | NGram | Lookahead
  optimizations: { chunkedPrefill, prefixCaching, kvCacheRouting }   # typed knobs
  advanced: [{ name, config }]    # named break-glass — promote to optimizations over time

scaling:                          # composer turns this into a stock KEDA ScaledObject
  signal: Concurrency | Utilization | Both
  concurrency: { minReplicas, maxReplicas, target, window, scaleDownDelay }
adapters: [{ name, source }]      # multi-LoRA + LoRA-aware routing
```

**Replica == placement.** N replicas → N `ModelPlacement`s, each scheduled independently. Multi-node logical replicas (Kimi K2 PP=2) are still ONE MP — multi-pod via LWS within one cluster. Multi-region spread = multiple MDs + multiple `ModelEndpoint` route entries.

**`ModelService` is a sketch.** Routing-only target on `ModelEndpoint`; never a placement target. **Nic owns the dedicated-SaaS placement design** — provisioning a Together / Baseten dedicated endpoint is a separate concept; this CR is a placeholder pending that work.

**Namespace = environment.** 0..1 `ModelEndpoint`, 0..N `ModelDeployment` / `ModelService`, 0..N `ModelPlacement` per namespace. Pushing an MD revision triggers lifecycle reconciliation there. `CapabilityVocabulary` is cluster-scoped — single source of truth for hardware semantics.

**Consumer-index discipline.** Every field on the user-facing API has at least one named consumer (matcher / composer / backend adapter / gateway), spelled out in a `Field-level consumer index` block at the top of each XRD. No consumer → no field. That's why `requiredEngineFeatures` is gone: required features are *derived* from declared config (`roles` → disagg, `engine.optimizations.*` → typed knobs, `adapters[]` → multi-lora). Declare what you want; matcher derives what features that requires.

## Hardware taxonomy & reference clusters

The vocabulary above is grounded in a survey of GPU hardware across major inference platforms, GPU clouds, hyperscalers, and on-prem systems (Bassam's "GPU hardware survey and unified taxonomy", 2026-05-07). Four logical layers, organized by what changes together:

| Layer | What it describes | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Cluster** | facts about the whole environment | `cloud.provider`, `cloud.region`, `network.fabric`, `network.bandwidthGbps`, `network.airgapped`, `cluster.scaleUnit` |
| **Pool** | the homogeneous-group host shape (per `nodePool`) | `cloud.instanceType`, `gpuCount`, `interconnect.{type, bandwidthGBs}`, `cpu.{vendor, cores, platform}`, `memoryGiB`, `nics.{count, bandwidthGbps}`, `host.virtualization` |
| **Device** | per-GPU attributes (uniform across the pool's devices) | `vendor`, `product`, `architecture`, `formFactor`, `vramGiB`, `mig`, `capabilities` (set), `parentProduct` (for fractional / MIG) |
| Dynamic state | what changes at runtime (health, allocation, MIG state) | tracked separately, not part of the vocab |

A few load-bearing design choices in the vocabulary:

- **Capability sets, not boolean columns.** `capabilities: [fp8, fp4, mig, transformer-engine]` ages better than separate boolean fields. New formats are entries in the set, not a schema migration.
- **Predicates over equality.** `vramGiB >= 141` matches H200, B200, B300, MI300X. `vramGiB == 141` matches only H200. The former is what you usually want.
- **Architecture is metadata; capabilities do the matching work.** Hardcoding `architecture in [hopper, blackwell]` excludes AMD MI300X. The capability flags (`fp8`, `fp4`) are the durable expression.
- **Rack-scale needs `cluster.scaleUnit`.** `independent-nodes` for normal cloud SKUs; `nvl72` for GB200 / GB300 rack-scale (72 GPUs in one NVLink domain — the addressable unit isn't the node, it's the rack); `superpod` for NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD topology.
- **RoCE vs IB are distinct fabrics.** Same physical NICs (ConnectX) can run either protocol. OCI runs RoCE on Quantum-2 hardware AWS runs as native IB. The schema distinguishes via `network.fabric: ib | roce | efa | gvnic | standard` plus a separate `network.bandwidthGbps`.
- **OCPU vs vCPU.** Oracle prices in OCPU (physical core); most clouds use vCPU (hyperthread). Convert at provider import time and store physical `cpu.cores` consistently.
- **Fractional GPUs as separate entries.** H100 MIG instances and L4 1/8-slice (g6f) are separate device entries with reduced `vramGiB` and a `parentProduct` pointer to the underlying GPU. Cleaner than "0.5 of an H100."

**Instance-type macros wire SKUs into the taxonomy.** Each macro names a canonical shape and expands to typed attributes:

```yaml
instanceTypes:
  - name: H100-NVL-8x
    expands:
      vendor: nvidia
      product: H100
      formFactor: sxm
      vramGiB: 80
      capabilities: [fp8, transformer-engine, mig]
      gpuCount: 8
      interconnect.type: nvswitch
      interconnect.bandwidthGBs: 900
    aliases:                                   # per-cloud SKU strings
      - aws:p5.48xlarge
      - gcp:a3-megagpu-8g
      - oci:BM.GPU.H100.8
      - coreweave:gd-8xh100ib-i128
      - dgx:DGX-H100
```

Customers match on the macro string (`cloud.instanceType: H100-NVL-8x`) for the common case or on unpacked attributes for unusual constraints (`vramGiB >= 141 && capabilities contains fp8`). Same predicate engine, no new code path.

**Reference InferenceClusters from cloud SKUs.** Pre-generated `InferenceCluster` definitions per known SKU live in [`proposed-modelplane-api/examples/reference-clusters/`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/reference-clusters/) — AWS p5, GKE A3 Mega, OCI MI300X, CoreWeave GB300 NVL72, EKS H100 (no-DRA path). Customers copy or compose. Static today; the natural follow-up is a Crossplane provider that polls cloud SKU APIs and generates these programmatically.

**Commercial-offering framing.** The canonical-catalog work is the wedge:

- **Vocabulary tracking** — chip families, instance-type taxonomy, per-cloud SKU mappings, engine versions, quantization formats. Bounded, ongoing, high-leverage.
- **Reference clusters** kept current across NVIDIA / AMD / TPU / Trainium / Maia × AWS / GCP / Azure / OCI / CoreWeave / Crusoe / Lambda / Nebius / on-prem-DGX.
- **Continuous testing & benchmarking** — each reference cluster paired with a tested, benchmarked workload across every supported model family. Costly to maintain; what customers actually pay for. Natural fit for an Upbound-managed offering above the OSS default.

**Vocabulary tiers (where keys come from):**

| Tier | Source | Governance |
|---|---|---|
| Vendor (`gpu.nvidia.com/*`, `gpu.amd.com/*`, `tpu.google.com/*`) | DRA drivers | Consume, never define |
| K8s standards (`resource.kubernetes.io/*`) | WG-Device-Management | Track and alias as KEPs land |
| `modelplane.ai/*` | `CapabilityVocabulary` CR (Modelplane default + customer overrides) | The managed canonical catalog |
| User (`acme.example/*`) | User | Pass-through, unvalidated; first-class match via `<level>Selector.matchAttributes` |

## Risks (categorized)

**External dependencies — we don't control timing**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| DRA coverage gap (1.30–1.33 BYO clusters; NIM Operator DRA still Tech Preview) | `provisioning.mode` discriminator; emits `ResourceClaim` OR `nvidia.com/gpu` |
| KServe `LLMInferenceService` schema churn (v0.17 args→command; v0.18 storage migration) | `ModelPlacement` IR + version-pinned adapter per KServe minor; conformance test suite |
| Cluster Autoscaler not DRA-aware (pods stuck Pending) | Granular cold-start conditions; DRA-required pools fall back to non-autoscaling until autoscaler maturity catches up |
| `ResourceSlice` eventual consistency causes drift flapping | Quorum + 5min duration filter |

**Design tradeoffs — our choices**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Capacity reservation races (KAI #848 class) | Delegate to Kueue `ClusterQueue`; never own the counter |
| Three-autoscaler conflict (KEDA + HPA + WVA) | One autoscaler per replica dimension; KEDA-only initially, WVA layered later |
| Compound AI multi-deployment co-location | Future: `ModelDeployment.spec.affinity.coLocateWith` |

**Operational boundaries — contract with the cluster**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| CRD ownership conflict with KServe upgrades | `kserve` (BYO) and `managed-kserve` install modes; never modify CRDs we didn't author |
| Break-glass features no fleet member supports | `matchTrace` field-level failure; `Ready=False NoMatchingEngineFeatures` |

**User experience**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| `ModelDeployment` chunky for ML/App teams | Crossplane Compositions; starter Compositions in `examples/` |

## Open questions (Nic to call)

- **Default scheduler / backend.** Lean: `managed-kueue` + `managed-kserve` as opinionated defaults, BYO contracts for KAI / Volcano / Dynamo / raw-vllm. Confirm, or pick different defaults?
- **Label-vs-attribute matching path.** `deviceSelector` supports both `matchLabels` (primary) and `matchAttributes` + CEL (break-glass over declared attributes). Confirm dual-path is right, or commit to one?
- **DRA grounding contract.** When the chosen `InferenceCluster` has a DRA driver, the backend adapter emits real `ResourceClaim`s carrying the same predicates (mandatory for BYOC, optional for Modelplane-provisioned). Confirm this is the right split, or always-on for both?
- **Rack-scale as its own unit.** GB200 / GB300 NVL72 is 72 GPUs in one NVLink domain — the addressable unit isn't the node, it's the rack. Captured today via `cluster.scaleUnit: nvl72` as an env-level attribute. Open: should the matcher reason about the whole rack as one capacity unit for placements that span the NVLink domain (very large MoE with PP across the rack), or treat the rack as multiple `nodePool` entries?
- **Reference-cluster generation.** Static reference clusters today (committed YAML in `examples/reference-clusters/`); follow-up is a Crossplane provider that polls cloud SKU APIs and generates these programmatically. Confirm this is the right ordering, or push the provider sooner?
- **Dedicated-SaaS placement.** `ModelService` is routing-only; "provision a dedicated Together / Baseten endpoint" is a placement concept Nic owns. Rough sketch only here pending Nic's design.
- **`ModelObjective`-style intent layer.** Optional CR above `ModelDeployment` for SLO targets (TTFT, ITL, cost ceiling), reconciled by a planner — mirrors Dynamo's DGDR / DGD pattern. Worth a layer, or punt?
- **vLLM recipe consumption.** Reference `recipes.vllm.ai` from `ModelDeployment.spec.recipe` (compose-time resolution) vs. fork into a Modelplane catalog repo. PM-shaped call.
- **WG-Device-Management engagement.** Concrete deliverable (e.g. KEP-5316 comment with Modelplane's federation perspective by Q3) or hold?

## What ships v1 vs v2 (themed)

**v1 — Foundation**

| Theme | Scope |
|---|---|
| Substrate | Six CRDs (5 user-facing + `ModelPlacement` IR); env + node + device attributes on `InferenceCluster`; `managed-kueue` install on `InferenceCluster` |
| Matching | Two-level selector cascade (`clusterSelector` + `deviceSelector`) over declared pool attributes; typed `matchAttributes` + CEL escape; `matchTrace`; optional DRA grounding for BYOC |
| Workload API | Self-contained `ModelDeployment`; replica == placement (`spec.replicas` + scale subresource); `roles.{prefill, decode}` for xPyD disaggregation; `engine.{quantization, speculation, advanced}`; five-factor `scaling`; `adapters` |
| Composition | Matcher → `ModelPlacement` IR → version-pinned KServe adapter; DRA + device-plugin emission |
| Delegation | Kueue for quota; KEDA-only autoscaling on concurrency |
| Fleet routing | Hardware-heterogeneous + geo + compliance routing via `clusterSelector` and `deviceSelector`; multi-region spread via multiple `ModelDeployment`s + `ModelEndpoint` |
| Status & drift | Granular cold-start conditions; drift detection controller |
| Catalog content | Starter Compositions hand-authored from vLLM recipes |

**v2 — Fleet behaviors and breadth**

| Theme | Scope |
|---|---|
| Fleet routing intelligence | Fleet overflow (#48); active-active / active-passive failover; cost-aware fleet member selection; predictive autoscaling |
| Fleet KV cache federation | G4 networked tier as global cache fabric; LMCache / KVBM integration; fleet-wide prefix-aware routing |
| Fleet session affinity | Sticky sessions across regional ingresses; multi-turn chat lands on the same `(cluster, replica)` |
| SLO-driven scaling | TTFT/ITL targets; WVA integration; combined Concurrency + Utilization signals |
| Aggregated fleet observability | Roll-up TTFT / ITL / cost / queue depth into one logical service |
| Catalog automation | Auto-import controller for `vllm-project/recipes` |
| Compound AI | Multi-deployment co-location on one cluster |
| Modality expansion | Embedding, ASR, TTS, image, video |
| Standards migration | DRANET / `HyperNode` for inter-node fabric |
| Protocol expansion | `ModelEndpoint` WebSockets / gRPC for non-LLM modalities |

**Beyond v2 (post-roadmap):** an optional intent layer — a `ModelObjective`-style CR above `ModelDeployment` carrying SLO targets (TTFT, ITL, cost ceiling) and reconciled by a planner over the fleet. Mirrors NVIDIA Dynamo's DGDR / DGD pattern. Non-breaking layer; existing users keep writing `ModelDeployment`.

## Appendix: deliverables

Full proposed XRDs and example resources live in [`proposed-modelplane-api/`](proposed-modelplane-api/). The directory is a **design-time preview**: nothing there is wired up yet — XRDs aren't installed by `up` packs, examples aren't run by CI. Once we align on the API, XRDs move into [`apis/`](../apis/) (one directory per CRD, alongside the matching Composition) and examples move into the repo-root `examples/`.

**XRDs** (proposed CompositeResourceDefinitions):

- [`xrds/inferencecluster.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/xrds/inferencecluster.yaml) — cluster-scoped substrate, env + node + device attributes, `provisioning.mode`, `scheduler.type`, `backend.{type, version}`
- [`xrds/modelservice.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/xrds/modelservice.yaml) — namespace-scoped routing-only target (rough sketch — Nic owns the dedicated-SaaS placement concept)
- [`xrds/capabilityvocabulary.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/xrds/capabilityvocabulary.yaml) — cluster-scoped vocab CR (singleton, name: `default`)
- [`xrds/modeldeployment.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/xrds/modeldeployment.yaml) — namespace-scoped workload, K8s scale subresource for KEDA
- [`xrds/modelendpoint.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/xrds/modelendpoint.yaml) — namespace-scoped weighted routing across `Deployment` / `ModelService` / `External`
- [`xrds/modelplacement.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/xrds/modelplacement.yaml) — existing CRD playing the role of the intermediate representation (IR); one per logical replica (replica == placement)

**Substrate examples** (platform-team setup):

- [`examples/inferencecluster-prod-coreweave.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/inferencecluster-prod-coreweave.yaml) — production Coreweave H200 cluster; BYO `kueue` + BYO `kserve@v0.18.0`
- [`examples/modelservice-together.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/modelservice-together.yaml) — Together AI as a routing target
- [`examples/capabilityvocabulary-default.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/capabilityvocabulary-default.yaml) — the default vocabulary Modelplane installs (aligned with Bassam's hardware-survey taxonomy)
- [`examples/reference-clusters/`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/reference-clusters/) — pre-generated `InferenceCluster` definitions for known SKUs: AWS p5 (DRA), GKE A3 Mega (DRA), OCI MI300X (DRA + AMD), CoreWeave GB300 NVL72 (rack-scale), EKS H100 no-DRA (labels-first BYOC). Anchors the managed-catalog commercial offering.

**Workload examples** (ML/App team deployments):

- [`examples/kimi-k2.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/kimi-k2.yaml) — frontier MoE, multi-node (2× 8 H200), 5P3D disaggregation, FP8 weights + KV; demonstrates the typed-attribute predicate path (`vramGiB >= 141`, `capabilities: [fp8]`, `interconnect.type: [nvswitch, xgmi]`)
- [`examples/kimi-k2-eu.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/kimi-k2-eu.yaml) — EU-region sibling of `kimi-k2.yaml`; demonstrates the multi-region pattern (one MD per region; pinned via `cloud.region` + `modelplane.ai/compliance`)
- [`examples/qwen3-coder.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/qwen3-coder.yaml) — code completion, n-gram speculation, 3 LoRA adapters, 256K context; user-defined `acme.example/*` attributes for team affinity
- [`examples/gpt-oss-20b.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/gpt-oss-20b.yaml) — small MoE, scale-to-zero; demonstrates the labels-first match path (no DRA needed; matches on the NVIDIA GPU operator's `nvidia.com/gpu.family` node label)
- [`examples/assistant-endpoint.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/assistant-endpoint.yaml) — `ModelEndpoint` weighted across the three deployments + Together routing
- [`examples/multi-region-endpoint.yaml`](proposed-modelplane-api/examples/multi-region-endpoint.yaml) — `ModelEndpoint` routing Kimi K2 across us-east + eu-west MDs with Together spillover

**What's deliberately incomplete** (will be filled in during the move to `apis/`):

- `status` schemas are minimal — just conditions + a representative status field per resource. `matchTrace`, `compatibility`, and granular cold-start status will be elaborated when the controller code lands.
- Validation rules (CEL on the schema, `oneOf` discriminator constraints, cross-field invariants) are sketched but not exhaustive.
- The corresponding Crossplane Compositions are not in this directory — those are implementation. The XRDs declare the API contract.
- `KServeBackend` (already an internal XR in `apis/kservebackends/`) is not duplicated here, but it's where engine + features land in the substrate / runtime split.
- Dedicated-SaaS placement (Nic-owned) is intentionally absent. `ModelService` is rough-sketch routing-only.

**Where each XRD lands after alignment:**

| File here | Lands in |
|---|---|
| `xrds/inferencecluster.yaml` | `apis/inferenceclusters/definition.yaml` (replacing `apis/inferenceenvironments/`) |
| `xrds/modelservice.yaml` | `apis/modelservices/definition.yaml` |
| `xrds/capabilityvocabulary.yaml` | `apis/capabilityvocabularies/definition.yaml` |
| `xrds/modeldeployment.yaml` | `apis/modeldeployments/definition.yaml` (expanded) |
| `xrds/modelendpoint.yaml` | `apis/modelendpoints/definition.yaml` |
| `xrds/modelplacement.yaml` | `apis/modelplacements/definition.yaml` (expanded as the IR) |
| `examples/*.yaml` | `examples/` at repo root, or `examples/compositions/` for platform-team starters |
